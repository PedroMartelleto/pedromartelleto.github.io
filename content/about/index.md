I'm a CS student from Brazil, currently living in Germany. Since I was little, I've loved to code - it feels like a unique mix of giving creative space to logic while constructing something meaningful.

My areas of interest span everything from visuals (frontend and computer graphics), to apps (web, iOS), machine learning & data science, as well as lower-level code & algorithms (C, C++).
