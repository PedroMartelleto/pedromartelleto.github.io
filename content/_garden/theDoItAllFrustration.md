# The do it all frustration

Sometimes I find it hard to get focused because I have too many things to do. Kind of a paradox. The more things you have to do, the harder it can be to do them.

The solution: focusing on efficiency. Do not care about the progress you are making. Just pick a small part of anything. And do that small part well. If you enter flow great and, if you don't, pick a small part of something else and do that well. Just finish small bits.
