- Expected cost matrix

- Bayes decision theory
- In pratice, bayes decisions may not be optimal

- Depending on the cost matrix, two equal-accuracy systems may have widely different performance in practice
- Cross-entropy: integrating over all possible cost matrices
- Modern DNNs tend to have: high test accuracy, low cross-entropy
- How to stop earlier? Temperature calibration of the posterior
