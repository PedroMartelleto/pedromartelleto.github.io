What conditions need to be put in place for antifragility?

SPIRE model

Spiritual: sense of purpose, meaning -> more likely to overcome barries
Physical: stress, sleep, exercise, nutrition -> take breaks
Intellectual: people who are curious -> are happier and live longer. Deeply engaging with material (flow state)
Relational: number one quality for antifragility is growing through our relationships.
Emotional: gratitude.
