# Positively biased

It is almost impossible to escape irrational human cognitive bias.

Solution: use biases to our advantage.

For example: Leverage confirmation bias for social relationships.
Instead of assuming bad intentions, assume good intentions.

How could other human biases be used to our advantage? Worth a re-read of "Thinking fast and slow".

## Naive optimism and life decisions

- Assume it is gonna work out

- Reframe failures
