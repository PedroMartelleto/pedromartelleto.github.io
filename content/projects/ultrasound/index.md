## About

This project is open-source, and <a href="https://github.com/PedroMartelleto/Breast-Cancer-dBM">the code is available on Github</a>.

The core idea is to revisit breast cancer classification to identify potential digital biomarkers (dBMs)—features within the input data (e.g., specific regions in ultrasound images) that strongly correlate with target classes.

In breast cancer classification, the most obvious biomarker is the cancer itself. However, other parts of the input may indicate high risk factors or secondary effects associated with breast cancer. Many medical conditions exhibit such second-order indicators—patterns that are not directly part of the disease but are closely connected to its presence or progression.
